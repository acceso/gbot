()

- An event with this condition: ${cond null % 20} should match out of five
  times, this didn't work before (it mached four out five), it does now.
- IPv6 support.
- Re-tested under opensolaris/intel


gbot-051103
-----------
(Silent bot)

- Log in lowercase.
- Further autotools work:
	- Made dist-gzip et al. work.
	- regex script it's now compiled but not installed
	- add more --enable... --disable.. checks.
- Basic support for CTCP: action logged right, version, ping, userinfo and 
  time. Mostly implemented in the events file!!
- Bot ported to the Darwin kernel (MacOs X). There is a bug though, and
  regular expressions with \< and \> never match (10.4 not tested, I want
  a full xcode port).
- The bot can handle more than one flag on every event, if there are two
  exclusive flags, the first one takes precedence.
- Added a new flag: 't', to match events on a different thread, this is
  good for events which take long.
- Added a new variable: query, it behaves like ${chan} if the event match
  in a channel or like ${nick} if the event match in a query.
- Added a new variable: system, now we can do things like: ${SYSTEM ls -l}.
  As this variable strips '\n's and '\r's, it has also been added lsystem,
  which converts every line to a privmsg $query :text...

-----------
(Summer again)

- Changed fnmatch() to regexes in events (compile-time optional).
- Regular expressions are now pre-expanded when reading events file,
  this should speed up matching.
- SIGHUP now reload_events ()
- Main cfg file now accepts blanks around '='
- Use mmap () for config files
- Added a new field in the events file: cond
- Now it is possible use variables and chain events: ${set var = val},
  some variables are: set, cond, del and print, and operators
  are: ==, ++, +=, -=, ++, --
- Some events launched too often, added a percentual operator,
  a condition like: ${cond null % 20} would match 20% of the times.
- A syntax file for mc is now included under scripts/syntax,
  I like fancy colors.
- Numeric events are now allowed in the events file, for example:
  001::::::join #channel
  would give us autojoin.
- Own commands are now tagged when reading the events file instead of
  when a line was sent, should be faster.
- When lines were too long in events.conf, some text was not discarded
  but read as a new event, obviously this text was not a valid event
  and an error popped out, this is now fixed.
- Internal function calling from the events file has changed from:
  "func" to "func ( )" (spaces are optional)
- Regexes can have a colon inside if scaped: \: means :, \\: means \:,
  \< means \< and : means the end of the regex as before.
- Plenty of small typos and some bugs that didn't shown have been fixed
  after the use of lint.
- Regexes now can be longer and is possible to change REGEX_LENGHT at 
  compile time to make it longer or shorter.
- Messages with more than one mode should now be handled correctly.
- Logging improved a little.
- Server messages are now logged in a status file.
