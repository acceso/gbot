To-do
-----

- The code was written too long ago and it sometimes makes me cry :(.
  I no longer use IRC but many things could probably be redesigned.
  Right now I would not use C for this project so a port to some other
  higher level language would not be crazy.

- Add sessions.

- Add remote control with sockets.

- Port to windows (previous versions worked).
  Will probably need an IO layer.

- ~/.$(PACKAGE)/logs/ is not created in *BSD.

- Add "include" in events file. We could have a generic /etc/bot_events.conf
  with a line such as: include ~/.gbot/events.conf.

- Antiflood.

- Look for another nick if ours is busy.

- Add timers.
  For ex. we could check if our nick is free if it wasn't.

- Ideas for events.conf:
  - Local variables, something like: var $MyNick = "gemi"
  - Variables: ${file ~/file}.
  - $(randomline ~/file) gets substituted with a random line of a file.
  - Flag: 'o' to mean: nick should be an operator (will need sessions...).
  - Add a command to ask for the command list, could maybe be autogenerated.

- Plugin support.
  - Allow custom functions and variables for them.
  Ideas:
  - Memo service.
  - !seen.
  - trivial.
  - alkolochi :).
  - log saving and replaying.
  - spool directory, useful to trigger events from mail, sms, etc.
    maybe useless with a socket.
  - dcc.

- With some kind of authentication, should be possible to use the bot
  without sending the password every time.

- See FIXMEs and TODOs around the code.

- Read the new irc rfcs, and change accordingly.

- Add documentation.
