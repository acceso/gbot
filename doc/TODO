Todo items, more or less from top to bottom priority:
----------------------------------------------------

-> It seems it doesn't work in windows/cygwin (previous versions did)
   Port it to vstudio. Note: instead of porting the functions with
   #ifdefs, add wrappers to I/O.

-> ~/.$(PACKAGE)/logs/ is not created in *BSD.

-> Use a tool like sourcenav to try to simplify some code paths.

-> Use regexes as user masks, for ex. something like this would be possible:
   [nick1|nick2].*:text:command
   Some other fields would also benefit from regexes: look if it's worth,
   maybe just adding ! for: !#channel could be enough.

-> Add include in events file, this would make possible a for ex. a base 
   events.conf under /etc/ and an user provided one in ~/.gbot/events.conf
   Note: don't forget about recursion, the way it works now should be easy:
   for_every_file { read_events (file) } and within read_events:
   if (has_been_parsed (file)) return;. I should probably check for the files
   before wiping out the previous events.

-> Add local variables into events.conf, for ex. for aliases:
   var $MyNick = "gemi"
   Note: again beware recursion! ex: var $NEWNICK = Newnick${SUFFIX}

-> ipv6. This will be done if 1-I find an ipv6 capable irc server,
   and 2- I install ipv6 back into my home lan (it's just a useless
   geek toy for me).

-> Antiflood, with the timestamp field it should be easy with some kind of
   locking. Note: beware with threads! (if available)

-> Look for another nick if ours is busy. A timer could check when ours is
   free (maybe whitin another thread if thread support is available).
   This could be configurable from the events file.

-> More ideas for events.conf:
   Variables:
   -> ${file ~/ejem} expands to a full file.
   -> $(randomline ~/ejem) gets substituted with a random line of a file
   Conds (flags):
   -> 'o' --> nick should be an operator (need sessions, or.. could query?)
   Commands
   -> Add a command to ask for the command list, this list should be 
      autogenerated, it'd be hard to be up 2 date.

-> Research chroot(), especially since ${SYSTEM} and ${LSYSTEM},
   should be safe enough without it IM-very-HO :).

-> utf-8? Should work out of the box with a utf8 events.conf.

Big things:
----------
Note:
 I lack the motivation for these things, they won't ever get done probably.

-> Sessions. This is a must and the only missing core part IMHO.
   Note: this sould be done before plugins.

-> Plugins support. Note: try to move as much as possible into them.
   * They should be able to add their own functions:
      JOIN:etc:LOG($nick) $nick has joined $channel
      This should also be a good solution for i18n logging.
      (with i18n moved into events, one for each language can be provided
      as included file, maybe as a conditional included file if a LANG var
      is added to the main configuration file).
   * And their own variables (some non-esential variables could be moved
     out here).
   * timers?
   Some ideas:
   -> MeMo service.
   -> !seen
   -> trivial
   -> tamagotchi (alkolochi)
   Note: this'll need at leat one header installed with make install. see:
   http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Headers.html


Wishlist:
--------

-> This could be done as a plugin (if they are powerful enough): add a
   "spool" dir, for ex. this would be useful to trigger events from
   "the outside": mail, sms, ...

-> DCC.

-> With some kind of authentication, should be possible to use the bot
   without sending the password every time. This is not very useful to me.


Every now and then:
------------------

-> Parts too indentated should probably be redesigned.

-> See FIXMEs and TODOs around the code.

-> Read the new irc rfc, and change accordingly.

-> Add documentation :) Up to now things have change too much to
   have it up to date.
