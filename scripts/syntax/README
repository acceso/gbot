gbot.syntax
-----------

gbot.syntax is a syntax file for mcedit,
to make it work add this two lines to ~/.mc/cedit/Syntax :

file events\.conf$ Gbot\sConfiguration
include gbot.syntax

Note: now the bot can use numeric events, this breaks in some way the colors,
I think I won't waste more time to make this work.
