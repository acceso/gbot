Gbot is a simple and yet powerful IRC bot.


Its configuration file is based on events, these are some examples:


# Needed ping-pong event:
PING:::::n:PONG :${1}

# This logs every line, 'c' means "continue with more events":
ANY:::::c:log()

# Gives op to "user*" with any ident and host and it happens on every channel (#*),
# it also says hello to that user when joining to the channel:
esta linea me da op y me saluda cuando me uno a cualquier canal:
JOIN:#*:user*!*@*::::MODE ${chan} +o ${nick}${SEP}PRIVMSG ${chan} :hi ${nick}!

# It joins automatically to #channel:
001::::::JOIN #channel

# This is probably the shortest CTCP implementation ever (4 lines, see full config):
CTCP:::^TIME:::NOTICE ${nick} :TIME ${date} ${time}

# We can make the bot speak for us:
PRIVMSG:::${pass}[ ]say[ ]+.+[ ]+.+:::PRIVMSG ${3} :${4*}

# It sends the output of "ls -l",
# 't' means it's done on a new thread.
PRIVMSG:#*::\\::t:${LSYSTEM ls -l}

# These two are chained. 
# The first one just matches if the second one has previously matched:
PRIVMSG:#*::\\[ ]*\\[ ]*\\?:${cond are > 1}${del are}::PRIVMSG ${chan} :sample2
PRIVMSG:#*::\\[ ]+\\[ ]*\\?:${set are = 1}::PRIVMSG ${chan} :sample1
